# Ball Movement

## Description 

This is a project intended to move objects on web applications, showed as balls here, buy could be any HTML object or image.<br>
We are using technologies learned in **Full Stack Web Development Course of MITx pro**

## Installation

In the repo, you could find all files needed to run this application.

## Usage

You can use this code to move any HTML object in your web application, powered with JS to achieve the functionality you intend.
### Instructions

1. Call factory function from console, with the number of desired balls as an argument.
2. Then, call update function to start movement.
3. Enjoy simulation and try to improve the code.

### Functionality explanation

- Each ball will start in a random color, x and y coordinates, also random vertical and horizontal velocity.
- When update function is fired, ball starts moving left, and down, horizontal speed will be constant, while vertical speed will increase if ball is going down and decrease if it is going up, simulating being affected for some external force such as gravity.
- If ball reach any border, will change direction, this works for horizontal and vertical axis.

## Roadmap

- This first version, uses some useful features, to move a ball in a closed area, with given width and height.<br>
- In following versions, we will implement new features, such as colition detection between balls, energy conservation, etc.
